# YOLOv8_finetune_for_pet_detection

At this project I've used data from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/dog-and-cat-detection/data

The purpose of this project was to finetune YOLOv8 and become familiar with this type of tasks.

At this notebook you can see the result, which could be much better, using more epochs while training, but even though there was only 20 epochs yhe result is already fine.
